In this paper, we consider episodic RDPs and show that it is possible to overcome the limitations of existing offline RL algorithms for RDPs via the introduction of two original techniques: a novel metric grounded in formal language theory and an approach based on Count-Min-Sketch (CMS). We derive Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) sample complexity bounds associated to each of these techniques, and validate the approach experimentally.
