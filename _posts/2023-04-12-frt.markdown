In this work we aim to analyze recent publications on FRT benchmarks, and propose questions on the racial composition of datasets and accuracy reports on racial subgroups. Our analysis indicates that a significant portion of the papers does not consider any kind of bias, some racial groups are underrepresented in the datasets used, and there is a need for taking these factors into account while analyzing facial data, otherwise posing limitations in the performance of the FRTs.
